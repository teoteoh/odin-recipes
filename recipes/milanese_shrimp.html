        <h2>But what <i>is</i> Milanese Shrimp?</h2>

        <p>Milanese shrimp. What else is there to say? A favourite of my friend M's, they are the perfect goodness of the shrimp, which even plain is perfectly palatable, with crispy,  egg and flour based fried covering. An absolute must-have in anyone's culinary bucket list.
